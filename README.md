# Some Data Structures-Implementations-Cpp

generic_tree : implementation of self balancing AVL tree with rotations.
rank_tree : use of the AVL with additional information in each nodes which improves some operations complexity.

Different binary trees implementations I had to write and use for project in Data structure courses.
I used thoses files as part of project in which I had to implement the management of a university schedule : adding,storing, deleting courses (which one includes Lectures themselves include students), scheduling lectures without overlapping ect

In a second work I had to use (and so implement) an Union Find structure base on inversed tree that I also attach here. The courses I handled in the first work could now be merged and management of students/lectures was to be implemented in consequence.
